🤖 Project Jarvis: Automation Core
Automated Workflows for CI/CD and System Maintenance

Jarvis Automation Core is an open-source command-line tool and scripting suite designed to eliminate repetitive tasks in the software development lifecycle. Built to serve as the backbone for your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and operational maintenance, Jarvis focuses on creating resilient, self-healing workflows.

Its primary goal is to provide developers and DevOps teams with a set of automated, reliable functions that manage everything from code quality checks to production deployments, allowing your team to focus exclusively on developing features.

⚙️ Core Automated Functions

This section is where you would list the specific functions your Jarvis can perform.

Continuous Deployment Pipelines: Automated build, test, and deployment routines triggered by code merges.

Scheduled Maintenance: Functions for database backups, log rotation, and server health checks that run automatically on a set cadence.

Code Quality Enforcement: Automated scripts to run linters, security scans, and unit tests against new pull requests.

Environment Provisioning: One-command functions to spin up new development or staging environments.
